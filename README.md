## Insights
- The Buy & Hold ever so slightly out performed the Golden Cross during a period of high growth for Nvidia
- The Golden Cross strategy had lower volatility and significantly lower drawdowns, meaning it had a smoother ride with less severe losses during market pullbacks
- This shows that the Golden Cross can be an effective strategy for mitigating risk, while not losing too much on the returns side
